# Odoo Associate and Share Management

This is an Odoo project for managing associates and shares in a company. The project includes custom modules for managing associates and shares, as well as custom views for displaying information about associates and shares.

## Usage

The project includes two custom modules:

- `custom_associate`: A module for managing associates, including their basic information such as name, email, and phone number.

- `custom_share`: A module for managing shares, including the number of shares held by each associate and their purchase price.

Both modules include custom views for displaying information about associates and shares, as well as custom wizards for performing actions such as creating new shares or transferring shares between associates.
