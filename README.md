# Associates Management Modules for Odoo V16

This repository contains three separate Odoo modules:

- `Associates`: This module allows the management of associates, shares, and operations around the capital management of a company.

- `Legal Form`: This module adds a field in the partner and company view to specify the legal form of the company. The module comes with numerous pre-registered legal forms per country.
